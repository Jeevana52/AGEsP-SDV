# AGEsP-SDV

Agentic GenAI Service for Predictable Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) Development.

## Problem
Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) feature requirements are often high-level, ambiguous,
and difficult to convert into predictable, compliant, and testable vehicle software.

## Solution
AGEsP-SDV uses specialized Agentic GenAI components to transform SDV feature
requirements into structured, service-oriented software artifacts that are
extensible and suitable for downstream development and validation.

## Initial Agent Pipeline (PoC)
1. Requirement Agent ✅
2. Service Design Agent ✅
3. Code Generation Agent ✅
