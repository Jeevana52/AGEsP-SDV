# AGEsP-SDV

Agentic GenAI Service for Predictable Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) Development.

## Problem
SDV feature requirements are often high-level, ambiguous, and difficult to convert
into predictable, compliant, and testable vehicle software.

## Solution
AGEsP-SDV uses specialized GenAI agents to convert SDV feature requirements into
structured, service-oriented software artifacts.

## Initial Agent Pipeline (PoC)
1. Requirement Agent (In Progress)
2. Service Design Agent (Planned)
3. Code Generation Agent (Planned)

## Current Status
- Project structure initialized
- Requirement Agent v0 under development
