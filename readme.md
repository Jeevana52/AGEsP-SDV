# AGEsP-SDV

Agentic GenAI Service for Predictable Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) Development.

## Problem
Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) feature requirements are often high-level, ambiguous,
and difficult to convert into predictable, compliant, and testable vehicle software.

## Solution
AGEsP-SDV uses specialized Agentic GenAI components to transform SDV feature
requirements into structured, service-oriented software artifacts that are
extensible and suitable for downstream development and validation.

## Initial Agent Pipeline (PoC)
1. Requirement Agent ✅
2. Service Design Agent (Planned)
3. Code Generation Agent (Planned)

## Progress Log

### Session 1
- Project setup
- GitHub integration
- Initial agent architecture

### Session 2
- Requirement Agent v1 implemented
- Structured SDV service output defined
- Example input/output added

## Current Status
- Project structure initialized
- Requirement Agent v1 implemented
- Structured SDV service output defined
- Example SDV requirement output added

## Next Steps
- Enhance Requirement Agent with LLM-based reasoning
- Implement Service Design Agent
- Add schema validation and consistency checks
